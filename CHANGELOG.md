# Changelog

All notable changes to the Headai MCP Server are documented in this file.

Server: **mcp.headai.dev** | Hosting: **Railway** (auto-deploy from GitHub main)

---

## [1.3.4] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Corrected MCP tool annotations on 13 of 23 tools to match actual behavior** (OpenAI Apps SDK review rejection fix):
  - `openWorldHint` → `false` on all 23 tools. Per OpenAI's review criteria, `true` is reserved for tools that can change publicly visible internet state. All Headai tools operate against the first-party API with private, token-scoped artifacts.
  - `readOnlyHint` → `false` on `text_to_graph`, `text_to_keywords`, `career_navigator`, `foresight_agent` — they create stored artifacts under the API token.
  - `idempotentHint` → `false` on all artifact-creating tools (`scorecard_v2`, `join_graphs`, `modify_graph`, `translate_graph`, `digital_twin`, and the four above) — each call creates a new stored artifact.
  - `fetch_and_save` → `readOnlyHint: false`, `destructiveHint: true` — it writes to the server container filesystem and silently overwrites existing files at `save_path`.
- Added per-tool annotation rationale comments in `src/index.ts` (also used as justifications in the OpenAI resubmission — see `openai-resubmission-notes.md` in the project folder).

## [1.3.3] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Removed diacritics normalization that broke Finnish programme name matching.** The v1.3.2 `normalizeFieldScoping` function stripped diacritics from field-scoped values (ä→a, ö→o), assuming the curriculum index uses ASCII. It doesn't — Megatron stores original Finnish characters. `programme:Tieto- ja viestintätekniikka` (with ä) returned 231 nodes; the normalized `programme:tieto- ja viestintatekniikka` (with a) returned 0. The function now passes values through as-is, only trimming whitespace.

---

## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **BKG v2 cross-type field scoping (school:X,programme:Y) now returns real results instead of 0 nodes.** Root cause: `word_type: "only_compounds"` was always sent to Megatron, even for field-scoped queries. This parameter breaks Megatron's cross-type AND logic — `school:SAMK,programme:Tieto- ja viestintätekniikka` returned 0 nodes with it, 231 nodes without it.
- When field scoping is detected in `search_text` (school:, programme:, title:, description:, curriculum: prefixes), the MCP now omits `word_type`, `enable_semantic_cleaning`, and `analyze` from the payload. Megatron uses its own server-side defaults, which handle field scoping correctly.
- Preview gate updated to show when field scoping bypass is active instead of suggesting `word_type="only_compounds"` for field-scoped queries.

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **MCP sessions now survive Railway redeploys.** Previously every deploy wiped the in-memory `transports` and `sessionApiKeys` maps, which silently broke every active Claude.ai / ChatGPT / Copilot connection — the client kept sending requests with its cached `mcp-session-id`, the server returned 400 "No valid session ID provided", and tools just stopped working until the user disconnected and reconnected.
- `sessionApiKeys` is now backed by `PersistentMap("session:apikey", 86400)` — Redis-persisted, 24h TTL refreshed on activity.
- When a stale `mcp-session-id` arrives, the server looks the API key up in Redis, builds a fresh `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` bound to the **same** sid, pre-flips the SDK's internal `_initialized` flag to skip the handshake, and processes the request transparently. Client never sees a session drop.
- Stale sessionId without a cached key now returns `-32004 "Session expired or not found. Please re-initialize."` instead of generic `-32000 "Bad Request"` — gives well-behaved clients a clearer signal to re-init.
- Health endpoint version string corrected from stale `1.2.11-analytics` to `1.3.1`.

### Why this matters
- Pre-fix: every push to `main` triggered Railway redeploy → all Claude.ai users had to manually reconnect (re-paste API key) to get tools working again.
- Post-fix: redeploys are invisible to clients. Same `mcp-session-id` works through any number of pod restarts within the 24h TTL window.
- Connection survives because OAuth tokens were already persisted (1.2.10), and now MCP sessions are too.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Scorecard v2 polling now handles all Megatron status strings** (calculating, processing, queued, pending, running). Fixes the TextToGraph-vs-BKG comparison path through the MCP that was failing with "unknown status" before.
- Unknown polling statuses continue polling instead of returning an error; error status gets one second-chance graph fetch before giving up.
- Annotations corrected on 6 write tools (BKG v2, Scorecard v2, Signals, Join, Modify, Translate) — `readOnlyHint` changed from `true` to `false`. Required for ChatGPT App Store resubmission.

### Changed
- `headai_run_analyst` reorganized into 5 priority tiers (Overview → Deep → Scorecard → Signal → Comprehensive) with suggested chains.
- Playbook trimmed from 5500 to 1300 chars — removed behavioral instructions, kept the factual reference only.

### Added
- Guardrail: `scorecard_v2` documentation explicitly states it can compare **any two graph types**, preventing the LLM from hallucinating format incompatibility.
- Guardrail: curriculum queries must use BKG with `school:` field scoping, not `text_to_graph`.

---

## [1.2.12] - 2026-06-02

### Removed
- **v1 tools removed from the MCP surface** — `headai_build_knowledge_graph` and `headai_scorecard` (v1) are gone. Only the v2 engines remain (`headai_build_knowledge_graph_v2`, `headai_scorecard_v2`). v1 was already deprecated and v2 fully replaces both graph building and scoring. Tool count: 23.

### Changed
- **Default build size is now 100** (was 300) on `headai_build_knowledge_graph_v2` — faster and cheaper by default. Larger sizes (300 quality, 500 deep) are used only when the user explicitly asks for a stronger build.
- **Analysis algorithms reframed** — `headai_run_analyst` and the public API docs no longer surface internal report numbers or "Junior" terminology. Algorithms are named by purpose (gap analysis, quick wins, hubs, emerging/fading trends, quality score, …); numeric codes remain only as the call mechanism and are never shown to end users.

### Deprecated
- **SDG-preset scoring** was a v1-Scorecard-only feature and is deprecated with the v1 removal. The SDG mapping playbook now uses Scorecard v2 as a best-effort semantic match.

---

## [1.2.11] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **MCP usage analytics** — Lightweight Redis-based telemetry tracking platform breakdown (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.), tool popularity, session volume, and unique API key cardinality. Fire-and-forget design — analytics never blocks or crashes the MCP server. All data stays in private Redis with 90-day TTL.
- **Analytics dashboard** — Self-contained HTML dashboard at `/analytics/dashboard` with KPI cards, platform bars, tool ranking, daily table, and recent event stream. Dark theme, no external dependencies.
- **Analytics API** — JSON endpoint at `/analytics?days=N` for programmatic access. Both endpoints require Bearer token authentication — no anonymous access.

## [1.2.10] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Redis token persistence** — OAuth client registrations and auth codes now survive Railway deploys. Uses `ioredis` with Railway's internal Redis addon (`REDIS_URL` env var). Graceful fallback to in-memory if Redis is unavailable — zero risk of breaking existing behavior. Health endpoint now reports `redis: "connected"` or `"unavailable"`.

### Fixed
- **OAuth token-wipe-on-deploy** — Previously, every Railway deploy wiped all in-memory OAuth client registrations, causing connected users (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot) to get silent errors until they reconnected. With Redis persistence, registered clients survive restarts. This was a marketplace submission blocker.

## [1.2.9] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Media tracking prompt templates** (`bea07f8`) — Two new MCP prompts available to all connected clients:
  - `headai-media-tracking` (English) — Track entities in news across 7 quarters, scorecard comparison, offers Sankey + network viz as follow-ups
  - `headai-mediaseuranta` (Finnish) — Same workflow in Finnish with Finnish-language noise list and corpus defaults
  - Both auto-calculate quarter boundaries, enforce sequential builds, and include domain-specific noise lists

## [1.2.8] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **Analyst reports now opt-in only** (`8d4316f`) — Removed mandatory "AFTER EVERY ANALYSIS: run_analyst" from both playbook sections. Analyst reports are now only triggered when user explicitly asks for deeper analysis. Saves ~30-50% tokens per conversation turn. Updated all 10+ example orchestrations and all prompt templates.

### Fixed
- **JoinKnowledgeGraphs array→string serialization** (`aaa03cf`) — LLMs send `urls` as JSON array but Headai API expects comma-separated string. Tool was completely non-functional via MCP. Schema now accepts both formats via `z.union([string, array])` with automatic normalization. Bug reported by Harri.
- **BuildSignals same array→string issue** (`aaa03cf`) — Applied same defensive fix to `urls` and `map_legends` parameters.

## [1.2.7] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Scorecard v2 tool** — New `headai_scorecard_v2` with automatic semantic matching (cosine similarity node merging), async execution, persistent result URLs, and richer scoring (full_score, important_topics_score, data quality indicators). Uses `/v2/Scorecard` endpoint. Preferred over v1 for graph-vs-graph comparisons.

### Fixed
- **Scorecard v2 internal polling** — Tool now polls the result URL internally for up to ~90 seconds instead of returning async "calculating" status. LLM clients no longer need to handle polling — the tool blocks until results are ready, just like v1 Scorecard.

### Changed
- **Playbook method table updated** — Score row now recommends `headai_scorecard_v2` (preferred) with v1 as fallback for text-based/SDG comparisons. Comparison flow example uses v2.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **BKG v2 word_type defaults to "only_compounds"** — Single-word noise (e.g. "innovation", "applicant", "continue") eliminated by default. LLMs no longer need to specify this parameter — clean graphs out of the box.
- **Playbook enhanced with company query guidance** — Added COMPANY-SPECIFIC QUERIES section (Finnish language for Finnish companies, no year-filter on job_ads, estimate_size first, search_text strategy), MULTI-BUILD COMPARISONS (plan before building), and VISUALIZATION (no external links in workspace).

## [1.2.5] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Pre-seeded Teams Copilot OAuth client** — Hardcoded the Microsoft Teams / Copilot declarative agent OAuth client credentials in the `registeredClients` Map so they survive Railway restarts. Previously, dynamically registered clients were lost on every deploy. Client ID: `833df4c8-...`, redirect to Teams OAuth callback.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- **ChatGPT cross-tool parameter leakage** — Removed `high_privacy_mode` from `text_to_graph` and `text_to_keywords` tool schemas (parameter was visible to LLMs, causing them to send it to BKG which doesn't support it → Zod validation errors). Added optional-ignored safety-net `high_privacy_mode` parameter to `build_knowledge_graph` and `build_knowledge_graph_v2` schemas so any cached LLM memory of the parameter won't crash. Internal server-side calls still pass the parameter to Headai API where it's supported.
- **Docs HTML cleanup** — Removed `high_privacy_mode` rows from text_to_graph and text_to_keywords parameter tables in built-in documentation.

### Added
- **OpenAI domain verification** (`702bdf8`) — Added `/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge` endpoint serving the verification token for ChatGPT Apps marketplace submission.
- **OAuth auto-registration for unknown clients** — `/oauth/authorize` and `/oauth/token` now auto-register unknown client_ids instead of rejecting them. Fixes "Unknown client_id" errors after server restarts when clients (like ChatGPT) cache DCR client_ids. PKCE code_challenge/code_verifier still protects the token exchange.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **OAuth 2.1 PKCE compliance** (`45b0396`) — Upgraded authorization flow from OAuth 2.0 to 2.1 with mandatory S256 PKCE. Public clients (like Claude Desktop) can now authenticate without client_secret by using code_verifier/code_challenge. Removed "plain" from supported challenge methods. Confidential clients still fall back to client_secret when no PKCE challenge is present.
- **Google Search Console verification** (`dcacbdc`) — Added verification HTML file for domain ownership proof, enabling indexing requests.

### Fixed
- **Complete favicon stack** (`5019465`, `2d5d996`, `7c0d742`, `4286065`) — Added multi-size PNG (16–512px), SVG favicon, web manifest, and apple-mobile-web-app-title. Ensures Google's favicon API and all browsers/platforms display the Headai logo correctly.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-24

### Changed
- **Marketplace-ready tool descriptions** (`8b79182`) — Removed all behavioral directives (ALWAYS/NEVER/CRITICAL/DO NOT) from tool description fields. Factual content preserved; orchestration logic remains in playbook response. Passes Anthropic's prompt-injection review criteria.
- **Origin header validation** (`8b79182`) — Added configurable Origin allowlist (MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS env var) with defaults for claude.ai, chatgpt.com, copilot.microsoft.com, headai.dev.
- **Softer error messages** (`8b79182`) — ERROR_SUFFIX changed from directive to factual note.

### Added
- **REVIEWER_GUIDE.md** (`8b79182`) — Step-by-step setup guide for marketplace reviewers with test API key, example scenarios, and architecture notes.
- **Title vs legend convention documented** (`8b79182`) — Added Headai naming convention to every parameter that accepts `legend` or `title` across 8 tools (`text_to_graph`, `build_knowledge_graph`, `build_knowledge_graph_v2`, `scorecard`, `join_graphs`, `modify_graph`, `build_signals`, profile/CV builder). Source: Harri Ketamo — when title is empty, legend acts as the canonical name; when both are set and differ, they refer to different entities with separate histories. Tool descriptions use factual prose (no CAPS directives) per the marketplace style established in `8b79182`.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed
- **check_build_status recognizes `status: "completed"`** (`2988e6d`) — BKG v2 returns `status: "completed"` with graph data inline in `response.data`. The previous code only handled `status: "ready"` and the no-status fallback, falling through to `status: "unknown"` for completed-with-status responses. This left builds wrongly tracked as active until 10-min ghost-eviction, blocking new sequential builds.
- **Remove language_mismatch block** (`109a63e`) — The `language` parameter controls which corpus to search, not the language of search keywords. The old check falsely blocked legitimate cross-language searches (e.g., Finnish person names in English media). Entire `detectLanguageMismatch` function removed.

### Added
- **Sequential build enforcement** (`121f611`) — MCP server now blocks new BKG builds (v1 and v2) while one is already in progress. Returns `status: "blocked"` with the active build's status URL.
- **Ghost build detection** (`121f611`) — Any tracked build older than 10 minutes is automatically evicted as a "ghost." Prevents stale entries from permanently blocking new builds.
- **Poll round limiter** (`121f611`) — `headai_check_build_status` stops after 5 rounds (~4 min) and returns the visualizer bookmark URL instead of hanging indefinitely.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **BKG v2 tool** (`d37a88e`) — New `headai_build_knowledge_graph_v2` with auto-legend detection, improved parameter handling.
- **Dataset inventory** (`d2effbe`) — Added dataset inventory, ontology presets, and data volume thresholds to tool descriptions.
- **Comprehensive API docs** (`3675a76`) — Full parameter reference for all 24 tools.

### Changed
- **Default BKG size 100 -> 300** (`457aeb9`) — Larger default graph size for more comprehensive results.
- **Keyword quality guidance** (`5fc5a76`) — BKG tool descriptions now include guidance on writing effective search keywords.
- **v2 BKG quality** (`a5c62e0`) — Recommend `only_compounds` + `noise_list` for better graph quality.

### Removed
- **External-LLM tools** (`011c756`) — Removed `composer` and `describe_graph` tools. Blocked `USE_GPT` flag.

### Fixed
- **BKG gate guardrails** (`00fede1`) — Improved guardrails for BKG confirmation gates, Compass, and tool descriptions.

- **Curriculum institutions** (`88fc650`) — Verified institution list, added hyphen warning and language tip.
- **BKG payload** (`2f66077`) — Added missing `type`, `update`, and empty-string params to BKG payload.

### Fixed
- **Async BKG + Signals** (`58355f9`) — Fire-and-forget with polling tool for long-running builds.
- **OAuth DCR** (`1b8c77b`) — Returns `client_secret_post` for Perplexity compatibility.
- **Build status polling** (`4ad504f`) — `check_build_status` polls internally (45s) to avoid session timeouts.

### Added
- **MCP discovery** (`78b6fb5`) — `/.well-known/mcp.json` for Perplexity auto-discovery. Fixed tool count.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Server resilience** (`6185c52`) — Health check endpoint, crash protection, startup self-test.
- **Progress heartbeats** (`1fe5218`, `6ce2828`) — Prevent `-32001` timeout errors on Compass, BKG, Scorecard, and BuildSignals.

### Reverted
- **Compass quality redesign** (`4965d60`) — Reverted emoji-based design in favor of analyst-style approach.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-04-20 to 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Concurrency guard** (`6356e6b`) — `MAX_CONCURRENT_HEAVY=1` prevents parallel heavy operations.
- **Internal name guardrail** (`b45922e`) — Never expose internal tool names or data pipeline details to users.

### Fixed
- **Size conflict** (`f2e0158`) — Confirmation gate now uses requested size instead of forcing 50.
- **Visualizer link** (`a3c4983`) — Match graph URL by `legend` / `search_text` instead of index.
- **Career Intelligence rename** (`d7c7166`) — Renamed all ENOT references throughout.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-06 to 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Confirmation gate** (`2620e2b` -> `a81c328`) — Hash-based enforcement replacing boolean gates. All parameters are mandatory blockers. Dataset-specific questions.
- **Visual report tool** (`4e617aa`, `7fbe858`, `1b30a32`) — Interactive visual reports from graph data. Returns structured data.
